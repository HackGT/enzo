# Contributing to enzo

Yay! Thank you for taking the time to contribute.

## Setting up your development environment
We're going to be using `enzo` to set up your dev environment. Very meta indeed!

You'll need to have `enzo` installed for this. You can get it from [here](https://www.example.com).

0. Create a workspace (if you don't have one yet)
```
enzo add workspace
```

1. Clone `enzo` into your workspace
```
enzo clone HackGT/enzo <workspace-relative-path>
```

2. `ez` into the project
```
ez <workspace-relative-path>/enzo
```

3. Finally, configure the repo
```
enzo configure
```

You're all set to start working on enzo!

## What should I work on?
Take a look at some of the issues [here](https://www.example.com). If you want to propose a feature, or work on something that's not
an issue yet, feel free to make an issue about, and discuss it before beginning work.
